#Restart=always
# You must fill in MYCALL & APRS_PASSWORD for this to work
# To send a PBEACON (fixed) for this station, uncomment and fill in LATITUDE, LONGITUDE
# To send a TBEACON (dynamic) for this station, uncomment and fill in either
#   1) NMEA_GPS with a serial device connected to a NMEA GPSD or
#   2) GPSD_HOST (and optionally GPSD_PORT) to point to a running gpsd instance
# For both PBEACON and TBEACON you can optionally provide a COMMENT
# Systemd isn't very good at environment variables with spaces in them, so you have to do it like this
